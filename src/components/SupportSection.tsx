            Throughout my career at publicly funded universities, I believed in making research and educational resources openly available as a form of public service. See, for example, my <a href="https://aivan.au" className="text-primary hover:underline">open materials</a> on using GenAI in Research. I want to continue this mission of open education, but creating quality learning materials requires investment in digital tools and platforms, making this venture financially unsustainable.

            Your support would help the next generation of doctoral researchers use AI tools effectively and ethically.

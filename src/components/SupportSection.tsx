            While I was employed by publicly funded university I believed that it is my responsibility to do public service - to create free academic content and to share it openly and for free. You can check out for example open materials on using Gen4iR in Research.

            I would like to continue to do it but unfortunately it is getting harder. Even if not counting my time, preparation of material requires multiple subscription & digital tools. If you want to support you can buy me a coffee or become a founding member. This would mean having early access to any materials and being publicly recognized as a supporter (you can opt out if you want).
